# Hello, and welcome to the Client/Server Development Repository of my Academic Projects🖐️

Applied database systems concepts to develop a client/server application that interfaces client-side code with databases. (NoSQL – MongoDB, Python, CRUD operations).

## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

- The way I write programs to ensure they are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is first by ensuring I follow industry standards and best practices, such as, following conventional naming standards and by providing in-line comments to help document the code. This ensures that the code is maintainable and readable and that other developers would understand what my code is trying to do.
  
- Also, the code is adaptable because it could easily be modified to accommodate any number of projects that need a CRUD Python module (based on client requirements), that can be used as the middleware for interacting with a MongoDB database and a dashboard that displays information to a user from the database. This can be done without having to change very much code.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

- As a computer scientist, I first approach a problem by understanding what is trying to be accomplished. I then break down the requirements into their individual components and begin working on the project to complete one task at a time. Once I have one component working, I then move on to the next requirement and so on until I have met all of the required functionality. The approach used to complete this project did not differ much because in every other course, even courses that were not computer science related, I had to first have an understanding of what the end result should be, then break down the project into individual components that I could work on, one task at a time. As one portion of the assignment was completed, I moved on to the next component until eventually I had a completed and working project.

- In the future, I would approach creating databases to meet other client requests similarly by ensuring I have a firm understanding of what their needs are. I would begin by developing the backend and setting it up so that it is ready to be used with the middleware (CRUD Python module) and the front-end web application. I would then modify the CRUD Python module to any specific requirements of that client, and then begin work developing the front-end web application that can be used to interact with the back-end.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

- Computer scientists work to provide solutions to a wide variety of complex problems. It matters because in the world of evolving technologies and increasing amounts of data, we need computer scientists who can develop software applications, systems, and even algorithms, that can be used to solve these complex problems and create innovative solutions.
  
- The work completed in this project is beneficial to companies like Grazioso Salvare because it significantly reduces the amount of time the company needs to spend looking at and sorting through data. They are also able to quickly find the information they are looking for and begin the work of training rescue animals more rapidly. The same principle could be applied to many companies that must be able to quickly sort through data to solve other problems.
